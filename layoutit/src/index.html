						<div class="panel-body">
							I am a 29year old CS major at Los Angeles City College(LACC) and part of the MEAN stack coding bootcamp being held in Los Angeles. <br><br>
I have been interested in computeres since I was young, and I was fortunate to have my father approve my interest. My first personal computer was when windows 95 cames out, and ever since I have been soul bound to this marvel of technology. Though computer started as personal thing, it quickly turned into volunteer/freelancer work by the time I was in junior high, and I have been learning the ropes on my own until recently. My latest interest was building an android app, and while taking Java class for that reason, my professor introduced me to MEAN stack bootcamp.<br><br>

I had been working as freelancer on tech field for quite some time: from creating personal website to setting up emails on mobile devices. The customers usually don't distinguish the fineline in technology so I ended up covering vast field including networking, mobile phone, application troubleshooting, bitcoin transaction, computer repair.<br><br>

So far at the camp we have been using Node server provided by C9.io and we have covered how to use MongoDB and Mongoose module to exercise basic CRUD commands on a database. Also we learned to simplify blockload of js code by requisition of express that allows simple app.get & app.post commands. Just started on Angular, and while at first it seemed like a simple superset jQuery, but during our current process of building a RESTful API utilizing all that we have learned so far, Angular proved to be far valuable tool<br><br>
